# Clean Lens

A simple VSCode extension that adds commands to specifically enable/disable `Error Lens`. Designed to be used with `VSCode Neovim`'s autocmds and editing modes to make Error Lens less intrusive.

*In the future, this extension will be better integrated so that no further configuration is needed.*
